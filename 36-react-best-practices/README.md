- [x] Write cleaner React code

## Objectives

**Opinions**

  - Containers vs Components
  - Organized by domain
  - Organized by page
- [x] Presentational vs Container components
  - Presentational
    - functional components
    - no state

  - [x] Destructuring
  - [x] Spread (w/ prepend and append)
  - [x] Objects with the same key/value name
